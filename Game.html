    <p>Important Note: the Singleplayer does not currently work</p>
    <p>The actual game file is called PaulMFinal.exe, the game consists of 2 or more default UE4 UFO models in an invisible box, to eliminate another player, get behind them and get up to their back.</p>
    <p>To do multiplayer (only tested on LAN), One person host a game with the max players set at at least 2. Any other users go into the server browser and click find games, the computer name of the host should appear in that list, click on the name to join their game.</p>
    <p>This game was developed by me for ApPauling Entertainment
