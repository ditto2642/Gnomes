<p>The CSG started in 2013 when a friend of mine found a crudely drawn gnome on a folder of his. He refered to the drawing as a demented gnome. We made a group, called the demented gnomes. This name evolved as we made a minecraft server and a website. We are now called the confused sacred gnomes.</p>
