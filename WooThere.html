<h1>Hinduism</h1>
<p>The core concept of Hinduism is peace and practicality through the following of rules in a class based system: “India’s original faith offers a rare look at a peaceful, rational and practical path for making sense of our world,” (What is Hinduism reading, Hinduism’s value today). India’s caste system is an important part of the Hindu faith working as intended. A key concept of Hinduism is Dharma, Dharma is God’s divine law, this law affects you based on what caste you are born into. The different castes have different rules which are part of Dharma, if you follow Dharma and live by the rules of your caste, you receive good karma. Conversely, if you do not follow Dharma and break the rules of your caste, you will receive bad karma. Karma in the Hindu faith is not the same as the karma in pop culture they are similar in idea but not exactly the same. In pop culture, karma is a sort of force that punishes you for bad actions and rewards you for good ones.</p>
<p>In Hindu, the karma you get from following or disobeying Dharma decides how you are reincarnated. In Hinduism, the soul is immortal. When you die, the soul leaves the physical body and enters an astral body in the astral plane; the astral plane is also where the soul goes while one is dreaming. While in the astral plane, the soul is able to choose what family they are born into. The bounds of their choice are based on karma, more bad karma will put them in a lower caste life or as an animal, good karma will let them choose a higher caste life. “Each reincarnating soul chooses a home and family which can best fulfill its next step of learning and maturation,” (10 questions about Hinduism, question 2). Through the lives, the soul gains experience. After many lives, when every lesson has been learned and karma is resolved, the soul reaches enlightenment and moksha, or liberation from the physical body.</p>
<p>This system incentivizes people to obey the rules of society as they are promised a better life later if they do so. Without the promise of a better life by obeying your castes rules, the caste based system where people have far more power than others at birth would not have worked for as long as it has. If a better life was not promised if rules are followed, the lower castes would likely revolt. Hinduism is a religion that values peace but its ideals give way to an underlying system to control the masses.</p>
