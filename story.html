<p>Mr. Rogers lived with his wife and 2 children three miles from the border of Villageville. They lived on a farm that raised cows, sheep, and pigs. For thousands of years, their family had been cursed with eternal loneliness. Even if surrounded by people, friends, and family, the Rogers would still feel empty and depressed inside. The Rogers siblings, Olivia and Micheal Rogers, wanted to change that.</p>
<p>As Olivia and Micheal were depressed for 13 and 15 years of their life respectively, they wanted things to change. They wanted to fix the problems where they originated. The problem of course originated by the person who layed the curse. After many hours of family research, they discovered the layer of the curse was none other than Donald Trump Jr.</p>
