<p>Mr. Rogers lived with his wife and 2 children three miles from the border of Villageville. They lived on a farm that raised cows, sheep, and pigs. For thousands of years, their family had been cursed with eternal loneliness. Even if surrounded by people, friends, and family, the Rogers would still feel empty and depressed inside. The Rogers siblings, Olivia and Michael Rogers, wanted to change that.</p>
<p>As Olivia and Micheal were depressed for 13 and 15 years of their life respectively, they wanted things to change. They wanted to fix the problems where they originated. The problem of course originated by the person who laid the curse. After many hours of family research, they discovered the layer of the curse was none other than Donald Trump Jr.</p>

<p>While researching, the teens realized that Donald Trump Jr. was a being created at the start of time. His essence permeated every corner of the universe it's just that at the time of finding, that essence was manifested as Donald Trump Jr.. They ventured many miles to reach the home of the Don. The journey was long, taking 17 months, but eventually they reached their destination.</p>
<p>They reached the massive house of the Trumps and knocked on their wall height (30 ft) door. They were startled when the bright orange face of Trump himself when he answered the door. "What is your purpose to come here?" he asked. To which the teens responded "We would like to see your son, Jr., sir Trump." "Very well" he responded.</p>
<p>They entered the house and stared in awe at the golden furnishings and paintings of Trump all paid for by his charitable organization, the Trump Foundation. Trump led them to Jr.’s room where he was reading through Trump’s tax returns, he had been trained to hide them when anyone entered the room for safety. When Jr. turned around, he studied Michael and Olivia’s faces and determined that they were part of the Rogers family. He said “I knew someday the Rogers would try to remove the curse and I suppose that day has come.”
“You’re right, now let us be happy again” Michael responded angrily.
“Very well, but first you must pass my test of knowledge,” Jr. answered in a calm tone.
